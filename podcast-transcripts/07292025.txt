This... is The Herd.
Where hot takes meet cold stats, and your fantasy excuses go to die.

Today, we’re diving into a league so competitive, it makes Wall Street look like Little League.
A league where managers rebrand, rebuild, and sometimes — collapse faster than a third-round handcuff in Week 1.

We’ve got one team that’s been to three straight finals.
Another that drafts like a conspiracy theorist with a clipboard... and still never finishes last.
And we’ve got a reigning villain — a hoodie-wearing, snap-count-tracking, emotionally detached killer who’s quietly becoming the Bill Belichick of your fantasy nightmares.

We’re breaking down keepers, dynasties, and draft crimes so outrageous they should come with court dates.

You want storylines? We got ‘em.
You want value? I’ll show you $1 quarterbacks and $30 mistakes.

This isn’t a recap show.
This is a reckoning.

I’m Colin Cowherd.
Let’s go.
Let me tell you something…

You ever walk into a fantasy matchup and just know you’re outclassed?

You’ve got your starters lined up. You made your waiver moves. You feel good.
Then you look across the digital sideline and see two words:

Jordan. Cunningham.

And suddenly, you’re not so confident anymore.

Jordan is this league’s Bill Belichick — not the Belichick clinging to a washed-up offense in 2023 — no, no. I’m talking peak Belichick. Dynasty-era hoodie. Cold air. Clock control. Mysterious, merciless, brilliant.

This is the guy who, in 2022, walked into the league as Appreciate My Greatness and absolutely flattened it.
Ten wins. Most points. And a title run that felt more like a military campaign than a fantasy season.

And what did he do afterward? Did he brag?
Nope.
He disappeared into the shadows like it was a CIA operation.

Then he reemerges a year later with a new team name — Embrace the Darkness.
The rest of the league laughed. “New name? New Jordan?”
No, no, no. Same guy. Just darker. Just meaner. Just... quieter.

Because here’s what you don’t understand: Jordan’s not playing the same game as the rest of you.
You’re thinking about Week 4 byes. He’s thinking about target share in Week 11.
You’re chasing flashy rookies. He’s collecting snap counts like blackmail folders.

He’s the kind of guy who drafts the tight end you meant to get. The QB you said you'd wait one more round on.
He’s the reason your draft room goes silent in Round 8 — because he just took your guy... again.

You can feel it when you play him. The weight. The inevitability.
You could be up 25 on Monday night and still not feel safe — because somewhere, buried on his bench, is a backup RB who’s about to put up 31.6 and three touchdowns.

Let me say it plain:

Jordan Cunningham is not a fantasy manager. He is a weather system.
He doesn’t come to compete. He comes to control.

And if you think two down years have weakened him?
Just remember: Belichick was 5-11 his first season in New England.
Then he won three rings in four years.

The hoodie is back.
And the league? You better have your playbooks ready... or Jordan's about to make another highlight reel out of your broken roster.

So when you see Jordan Cunningham on the schedule this season, just remember — you’re not preparing for a fantasy matchup.
You’re preparing for warfare.

He’s not here for fun. He’s here for rings.
The hoodie’s back. And he’s got receipts.

Now, if you’re someone whose draft is already slipping through your fingers…
Let’s talk about a little something called the Fantasy Football Disaster Draft Relief Fund:

You’re watching your draft unfold. You’re feeling confident. You’ve got your guy in the queue.
Then… boom. He’s gone.
Panic sets in. You tilt. You draft a second kicker. You reach for a rookie tight end. You start muttering about “ceiling” like you're on a real estate tour.

Sound familiar?
You may qualify for assistance from the Fantasy Football Disaster Draft Relief Fund — the league’s only support system for managers who drafted like they blacked out mid-Round 6.

At the FFDRF, we don’t judge your mistakes — we financially compensate them.
Reach for Zay Jones in the 4th? You’re eligible.
Drafted three defenses and forgot a QB? That’s called “Tier 1 support.”
And if you paid full price for a washed-up RB2 named “Mixon”? You might even get a commemorative coin.

The Fantasy Football Disaster Draft Relief Fund.
Because sometimes, the biggest opponent in your league… is your own draft board.

So... The draft is about to start...

Alright, let’s get into it.

Fantasy football, especially in keeper leagues, is not just about having good players.
It’s about having the right players… at the right price.

There’s always that one guy in every league — the spreadsheet savant who crunches ADP values like he’s preparing a hedge fund earnings call.

But then there’s Paul Konecny.

And Paul… is not that guy.

Let me talk about GangGreen for a second.

This man — this legend — shows up to every single draft and turns it into a performance art piece.

He’ll open with a kicker in Round 9.
He’ll stack the Jets, draft three Cardinals, and sprinkle in just enough Chiefs to make you question whether he’s watching tape or just picking his favorite Madden playbook.

And somehow… it works.

Year after year, Paul builds teams that make zero sense on draft night…
…and just enough sense by Week 14 to avoid the bottom of the standings.

He’s the league’s mad scientist.
His team looks like a garage sale, plays like a well-oiled machine.

We all sit there watching him hit “Draft” on Jake Ferguson for $3, and we're like,
"What is this man doing?"

Then come December? He’s 8‑6 and you’re holding the pink purse.

Which — let’s remind everyone — is exactly what happened to his son, John.

John’s out here breaking down keeper value with pie charts and probability matrices.
Paul’s taking Ravens D/ST for $1, Aaron Rodgers for $1, and Ty Chandler for $1 just because the vibes feel right.

And yet Paul… has never finished last.
Not once. Not ever.
And that pink purse? Never sniffed it.
Meanwhile, Advanced Metrics — his own bloodline — has tasted that floral shoulder strap.

It’s biblical.

Now let’s talk shop. Let’s get to the actual keeper decisions.

There are only a handful of guys in this league who should already have two names circled, laminated, and tattooed on the side of their draft board.

These are the automatic keepers:

Justin Herbert for $4 – Advanced Metrics

Brock Purdy for $1 – Boeing’s Hitmen

Garrett Wilson for $13 – Advanced Metrics

Jake Ferguson for $3, Ravens D/ST for $1, Rodgers for $1 – GangGreen

Anthony Richardson for $9 – America’s Team

Rome Odunze for $4 – Boeing’s Hitmen

Ty Chandler for $1 – GangGreen again. Yes, again.

These are the players that set you up.
They give you flexibility. They give you surplus value. They let you dominate the draft.

Then we’ve got the premium plays — the ones that cost a little more, but give you guaranteed juice:

Jaylen Waddle for $14

DK Metcalf for $18

Jahmyr Gibbs for $47

George Kittle for $12

Garrett Wilson for $13 (yes, he deserves to be mentioned twice)

These are your foundational guys.
They may not be $1 steals, but they’re worth every dollar based on production and opportunity.

And now… the keepers you need to let go.

Don’t do it. Don’t convince yourself. Don’t stare at the stat line from Week 6 last year and whisper, “But he helped me once…”

Josh Jacobs for $30

Joe Mixon for $35

Amari Cooper for $13

Deebo Samuel for $23

Saquon Barkley for $48

Tank Dell for $11

Najee Harris for $8

Drake London for $18

Kyle Pitts for $7

Zamir White for $16

Keeping these guys is like saving a lottery ticket you already scratched.
You didn’t win. Move on.

So here’s the takeaway:

If you're not keeping guys who give you leverage, value, or ceiling — then you’re just emotionally attached.
You’re keeping players for what they were, not what they are.
That’s not management. That’s memory-hoarding.

And the crazy part?
The guy who gets this best — might just be Paul.
He doesn’t run a spreadsheet. He doesn’t follow the rules.
But year after year, he keeps the right guys, finds cheap production, and walks right past the pink purse like it’s cursed. The same cannot be said about this son...

Now… if that last segment gave you heartburn, don’t worry.
There’s something smooth, peachy, and ice cold waiting for you:

Let me tell you something…

You just watched your “sleeper” tight end score 2.4 points.
Your opponent’s kicker outscored your flex.
Your team name is clever — your record is 0‑3.

It’s time to stop stressing…
And start sipping a Four Peaks Peach Ale.

Four Peaks Peach Ale: the official beverage of “I’ll fix it on waivers.”
Crafted with subtle fruit notes and just enough bitterness to match your fantasy season, it’s the only beer brewed specifically for Sunday tilt.

It’s refreshing. It’s honest.
It’s the taste of realizing your 8th-round “steal” was actually just… bad.

So this Sunday, grab a Four Peaks Peach Ale.
Because if your team’s gonna be a peach pit, you might as well drink something that still tastes sweet.

You know what I love? Consistency.
Not flash. Not hype. Not one lucky year and a lifetime of excuses.
I’m talking every year, every matchup, every lineup — dialed in, locked in, making you sweat.

Ladies and gentlemen… that’s Tarek Kaakani.

This man has been in three straight championship games.
You know how hard that is in fantasy football? That’s not luck. That’s not a hot waiver-wire pickup in Week 14.
That’s culture. That’s system. That’s dynasty DNA.

His team? Jensen Huang and Sons.
Sounds like a tech startup. Plays like the Patriots of 2003.
He builds like Belichick, executes like Shanahan, and drafts like he's reading two weeks into the future.

Let me walk you through this:

2022: Middle of the pack. He was good. Not great. Missed the playoffs.
What did he do?
He regrouped. Rebuilt. Recalibrated.

2023: Boom. 9-5. 1st in the league. 1,770 points. Title run.
Name a better comeback arc. I’ll wait.

2024: 10-4. Championship again. And not just sneaking in — 1739 points, second-most in the league.
This is a guy who took the league’s punch and came back throwing haymakers.

And his strategy?
Oh, he’s not sitting on $1 flyers hoping they break out.
He’s playing big. Jonathan Taylor, Justin Jefferson, Bijan Robinson.
That’s not a fantasy roster — that’s the All-Pro voting sheet.

And you might say,
“Well Cowherd, he only won one title in three trips…”
Yeah? And? So did the early 2000s Eagles. So did the 2010s Warriors before KD showed up.

Dynasties don’t need rings to be feared.
They need presence. And Tarek has presence.
Every move he makes in the draft — calculated. Every start-sit decision — intentional.
He drafts like he's holding a patent. He trades like he's negotiating a merger.

Here’s what separates Tarek from the rest of you:

He doesn’t chase headlines.

He doesn’t fall in love with rookies.

He doesn’t panic after one bad week.

He treats fantasy like a 12-week investment window.
You’re playing fantasy. He’s managing asset allocation.

You think it’s coincidence he’s in the finals every year?
That’s like thinking Tom Brady just got lucky seven times.
Come on.

So let’s say it clearly:

Tarek Kaakani is the most consistent, most prepared, most terrifying man in this fantasy league.
And if he wins another one this year?
We’re not talking about “Tarek the contender.”
We’re talking about Tarek the era.

And that, folks, is the show.

We roasted Jordan. We exposed keeper crime rings. We bowed to the Tarek Empire.

If your draft strategy is still “pick the guy I’ve heard of,” good luck this year.
Because the rest of the league? They're playing chess.

I’m Colin Cowherd. See you at the waiver wire.
